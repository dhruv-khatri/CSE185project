# GenomeSizer (CSE185project) in progress

This is a project for CSE 185. GenomeSizer is a tool that takes in a .fasta file and outputs an estimated genome size. This is comparable to the kmergenie tool for genome size. 

# Install Instructions
Installation requires the argparse and matplotlib libraries to be installed
```
pip install argparse
pip install matplotlib
```
Once the required libraries are installed, you can install genomesizer using the following command.
```
python genomesizer.py install
```
If the install was successful, typing ```genomesizer --help``` should show a relevant message.

# Basic Usage
The basic usage of ```genomesizer``` is 
```
python genomesizer.py <options> input_file
```
To run ```genomesizer``` on a small test example
```
python genomesizer.py -k 25 -o output.histo example.fastq
```

# genomesizer options
There are 3 required inputs for the ```genomesizer``` tool. Users may specify the options below:
 - ```-k```, ```--kmer-size``` 

# File Format
There will be a .histo file output.
